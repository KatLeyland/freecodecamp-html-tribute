        <li>Wolfie has been a puppy for quite a few years now. He may be a puppy forever, what is his secret? Regular mud baths and rolls in fox poo.</li>
        <li>Wolfie becoming Lauren's was fate. He was a borrowed doggy who decided this was his new forever home.</li>
        <li>Wolfie has an accidental housemate called Luna. Who knows how long she will stay. </li>
        <li>Wolfie will be a ringbearer at Lauren's wedding this year!</li>
        <li>Wolfie is secure in his masculinity and enjoys wearing pink.</li>
