# freecodecamp-html-tribute
Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks

Result: I achieved the objective and used a bit more CSS than previous projects, would have been a very modern website in the 90s!
I need to pay more attention to the design of wesites I use.
